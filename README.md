# BLOCKCHAIN WALLET

## CREATING A WALLET FOR MY BLOCKCHAIN AND SENDING TRANSACTIONS


For my project I chose the command line tool hd-wallet-derive which can manage billions of addresses across 300 + coins. It supports not only BIP32, BIP39 AND BIP44, but can also support non-standard paths for the most popular wallets out there today. 

I will be starting with 2 working blockchains, a custom Ethereum POA blockchain that I created previously called bzeth and the Bitcoin Testnet. 

## Dependancies
PHP must be installed on your operating system(any version, 5 or 7)
Clone the [hd-wallet-derive tool](https://github.com/dan-da/hd-wallet-derive)
[bit](https://ofek.dev/bit/) Python Bitcoin Library
[web3.py](https://github.com/ethereum/web3.py) Python Ethereum library. 


## Instructions

## HD Derive Wallet Install Guide 

This guide is a step by step process for installing/setting up the [hd-wallet-derive](https://github.com/dan-da/hd-wallet-derive) library used to derive BIP32 addresses and private keys for Bitcoin and other alt coins. 


## HD-WALLET-DERIVE INSTALLATION

Now that the lastest version of PHP is installed on our computers, we can proceed to the installation of the hd-wallet-derive library. 

Execute the following steps:

-Navigate to the [Github Website](https://github.com/dan-da/hd-wallet-derive) for the hd-wallet-derive library and find the installation instructions. 

-Next, open a terminal and execute the following commands. If you are using Windows, you will need to open the git-bash GUI via C:\Program Files\Git\bin\bash.exe directly to enable something called tty mode that makes the terminal more compatible with Unix systems. Once installed, you may move back to using the usual git-bash terminal.


git clone https://github.com/dan-da/hd-wallet-derive
cd hd-wallet-derive
php -r "readfile('https://getcomposer.org/installer');" | php
php -d pcre.jit=0 composer.phar install


-You should now have a folder called hd-wallet-derive containing the PHP library.


# hd-wallet-derive Execution

-Using a command line navigation to your hd-wallet-derive folder

-Then execute the following commands (these are examples from the GitHub website).



./hd-wallet-derive.php -g --key=xprv9tyUQV64JT5qs3RSTJkXCWKMyUgoQp7F3hA1xzG6ZGu6u6Q9VMNjGr67Lctvy5P8oyaYAL9CAWrUE9i6GoNMKUga5biW6Hx4tws2six3b9c


./hd-wallet-derive.php -g --key=xprv9tyUQV64JT5qs3RSTJkXCWKMyUgoQp7F3hA1xzG6ZGu6u6Q9VMNjGr67Lctvy5P8oyaYAL9CAWrUE9i6GoNMKUga5biW6Hx4tws2six3b9c --numderive=3 --preset=bitcoincore --cols=path,address --path-change

I constructed a .py file name wallet.py that which contains functions that enabled me to transact in my bzeth and btc. The following is a break down of the code:

## Function 1
derive_wallet calls out the dictionary of coins with addresses and private keys. 


def derive_wallets(coin):
    command = f"./derive -g --mnemonic='{mnemonic}' --cols=path,address,privkey,pubkey --format=json --coin='{coin}' --numderive= 2"
    p = subprocess.Popen(command, stdout=subprocess.PIPE, shell=True)
    output, err = p.communicate()
    p_status = p.wait()
    keys = json.loads(output)
    return keys

coins = {
    BTCTEST: derive_wallets(BTCTEST),
    ETH: derive_wallets(ETH)
    
}
print(coins)

## Function 2
This function creates the raw, unsigned transaction that contains all metadata needed to tranact. 



def create_tx(coin, account, to, amount):

    if coin == ETH:
        gasEstimate = w3.eth.estimateGas(
            {"from": account.address, "to": to, "value": amount}
        )
        return {
            "from": account.address,
            "to": to,
            "value": amount,
            "gasPrice": w3.eth.gasPrice,
            "gas": gasEstimate,
            "nonce": w3.eth.getTransactionCount(account.address),
            "chainID": w3.eth.chainId
        }
    elif coin == BTCTEST:
        return PrivateKeyTestnet.prepare_transaction(account.address, [(to, amount, BTC)])
        
        
## Function 3
This function calls the previous function, create tx, signs the transaction, then sends it to the designated network. 


def send_tx(coin, account, to, amount):

    tx = create_tx(coin, account, to, amount)
    signed_tx = account.sign_transaction(tx)
    if coin == ETH:
        return w3.eth.sendRawTransaction(signed_tx.rawTransaction)

    elif coin == BTCTEST:
        return NetworkAPI.broadcast_tx_testnet(signed_tx)
        



![BTC_TRANACTION](BTC_TRANSACTION.png)


I ran this function in wallet.py file: send_tx(BTCTEST, Account_one, address_two, 0.002) to send BTCTEST from one account to another (see folder screen_shots for more imagies).


# ETH Transaction

Local PoA Ethereum transaction

-Add one of the ETH addresses to the pre-allocated accounts in your networkname.json.

-Delete the geth folder in each node, then re-initialize using geth --datadir nodeX init networkname.json.
This will create a new chain, and will pre-fund the new account
